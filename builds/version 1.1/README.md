========

+ Used on 1999 xNBA Scouting and 2017 NLL Scouting.
+ Simplified the system. No more scouting areas, and no more letter grades.
+ Reports are released with certain deviations.

	FGD FGI FGJ FG3 DRFL - with +/- 2 points deviation (both current and potential)
	FT SCR PAS HDL ORB DRB DEF BLK STL DIS IQ - with +/- 7 deviation (current) and +/- 15 deviation (potential)

+ Tracking scouting points and number of times a player has been scouted.
+ Established base for Big Board, but still need improvements (tie into the tracker).
+ Solid, stable build overall.
